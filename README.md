# React-Node/Spring-Store
There is an entire store without some functions. 
The frontend was implemented on React JS. 
The backend was implemented on Node JS(Express JS) after the server part was implemented on Java using the Spring Boot Framework as a REST App. 
( Spring Security with JWT,  PostgreSQL with Flyway, and a few other libraries)

For full synchronization between Node JS and the backend on Spring, 
some database settings and ports for Tomcat and Node have been hardcoded, 
this can be viewed in the settings files and changed if desired.
